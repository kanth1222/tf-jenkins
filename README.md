
Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, concepts and terms which works together to automate the lifecycle of apps, in this regard if you want to implement a CI / CD, Jenkins could be the main tool to establish a server to automate this process. 

This repository is a simple task to deploy a Jenkins taking AWS amazon as IaaS. For getting a big picture we are going to install Jenkins and its plugins, register a user, set up a basic security rule and finally insert a job as example so, letâ€™s elaborate further this idea.

* access_key: your personal access key AWS amazon
* secret_key: your personal secret key AWS amazon

Please go to the base project and execute the follow command line:
